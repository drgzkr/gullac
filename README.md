# Güllaç Sheets
## Ingredients
- 2 cups lukewarm water
- 8 tablespoons wheat starch
- Silicone brush
- 28 cm non-stick pan for cooking
- Mixing bowl

## Instructions:
- In a mixing bowl, combine the water and starch.
- Whisk well until there are no lumps.
- Heat the pan on the stove.
- Sprinkle a few drops of water onto the pan. If it sizzles immediately, it’s ready.
- Pour a ladle of the starch mixture into the pan (adjust the amount depending on your pan size; one ladle worked for me).
- Quickly swirl the pan so the mixture spreads evenly.
-  Tilt the pan slightly like when making a crepe, then pour any excess starch mixture back into the bowl; the thin layer left in the pan will become your güllaç sheet.

- Keep the heat medium; not too high, not too low. When the sheet starts to lift from the edges, it means it’s almost ready.
- Fan the sheets as they cook, helping it dry faster.
- Once cooked, place the sheets on a clean cloth. When all are done, let them dry completely in a ventilated area or by running the oven fan.
- You can use them right away to make güllaç, or store them once fully dried.
(With these measurements, I got 8 güllaç sheets from a 28 cm pan.)
- It may seem a bit tedious, but if you follow the steps carefully, it’s actually simple.
